## Ideas: Bible Study
### What questions do I have?
* What are the primary words that appear in this section?
* How does this chapter cross reference to the rest of the Bible?
* What type of words are in the chapter (nouns, adjectives/adverbs, verbs, pronouns, etc)
* How do the words relate to each other (by proximity)
* Do these words appear elsewhere in the Bible?
* How does this version compare to other versions?
* Could I summarize that in text?
* NLP: Find other verses that have high similarity in text overlap?
* How is this word actually translated?

### Visualization Ideas
* Force Diagram: node size = word frequency; node color = word type; link length = shorter for more proximate words
* Force Diagram: begin with Greed word; node size = word frequency in Bible; links to English translations of that word; then links to Greek / Hebrew translations of that word; node color = word type (verb, noun, etc)
* Chord Diagram: Bible, relates words to other places in Bible these words are found
* Chord Diagram: Bible, relates TSK cross references
